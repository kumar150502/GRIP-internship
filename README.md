Assignment Details:

We have a Java application that sends OTPs as part of the authentication process. Please develop a prototype that meets the following requirements:

1. Generate a 6-digit OTP.
2. Send an SMS to your phone number with the message: "This OTP is valid for 5 minutes."
3. Validate the OTP.

You may use any free or paid SMS gateway that provides a Java API for prototyping.
